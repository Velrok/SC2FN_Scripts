# SC2FN_Scripts

SC2FN_Scripts is a collection of scripts I'm writing for oure private StarCraft 2 Fun League. As a result all scripts are highly specialised for oure needs and may not bee as flexible or well integrated as others may wish.

However this may be a starting point for you to build your own scripts or maybe this scripts do already satisfy your needs as well.

## requirements
The scripts are written in php and assume a webserver with php 5 support.
So far there is no need for SQL but this will change for some scripts sooner or later.

## whats included?
Since this is a __collection__ all scripts are independent of each other.
There are currently 3 scripts available:

* choose map
 * is a random map selector, that doesn't select the same map twice
 * to reset the pool one has to reload the page

* submit replay
 * contains a ui to upload 2 1on1 replays
 * one has to name the players and the winner for each game
 * the script renames the files and sends as an attachement to a email adress
 * we use a mailing list for this, so everyone gets the replays named the same


* report result
 * isn't working yet
 * it will read the meta data of 2 uploaded replays and use it to keep track of the wins and looses of the players. The goal is to keep track of the league points system.
